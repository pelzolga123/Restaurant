# Restaurant

## About The Project
Restaurant webpage is created dynamically with ES6 modules. Each tab is rendered dynamically by a separate module, each of which is imported from its own separate JavaScript file. Webpack then bundles all the source JavaScript into a single file, 'main.js', in the 'dist' directory.
